You need to know what you're doing before you start making changes on a live server.
You need to know HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript & JQuery to interact with this layout.
You do not create links from the live site to a test page, that is unprofessional.
If you don't know what you're doing, stay off the server.
